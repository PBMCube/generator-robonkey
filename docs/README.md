#Getting Started

> This section is comming soon.


####This generator isn't on npm yet, so if you want to use it, you'll need to:

First, download this repo. And install Yo:

	$ npm install -g yo

Make a symlink to your node working directory:
	
	$ cd path/to/generator-robonkey
	$ npm link

Then you can start building your app with Robonkey:

	$ mkdir yourapp
	$ cd yourapp
	$ yo robonkey
