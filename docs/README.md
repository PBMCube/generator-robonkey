#### This generator isn't on npm yet, so if you want to use it, you'll need to:

First, download this repo. And install Yo:

```sh
$ npm install -g yo
```

Make a symlink to your node working directory:

```sh
$ cd path/to/generator-robonkey
$ npm link
```

Then you can start building your app with Robonkey:

```sh
$ mkdir yourapp
$ cd yourapp
$ yo robonkey
```
